I recently found [this rad minimal roguelike](http://www.locklessinc.com/articles/512byte_roguelike/) and wanted to try and figure out what the heck is going on. It's only 512 bytes in C, which is insane, so I had to try and solve this little puzzle I was presented.

It's not worth going into super detail here, as it's all in the code, and seeing it move from a jumbled code salad into something meaningful is so fascinating to me.

Check out [the original article](http://www.locklessinc.com/articles/512byte_roguelike/) and [my annotated version](https://codeberg.org/milofultz/decrypting-the-minimal-roguelike/src/branch/main/3_annotated.c).
