[Jonas Schmedtmann's Coding Resources](http://codingheroes.io/resources/) - Chock full of good resources and helpful links for all of these.

*HTML*

* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)
* [This page is a truly naked, brutalist html quine.](https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html)

*CSS*

* [CSS Utility Classes and "Separation of Concerns"](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) - Going over the differences between semantic CSS and "functional" CSS, where reuse and ease of understanding is paramount.
* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) - Good overview of the basics of HTML and CSS design (pre-Flex or Grid systems).
* [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) - Shows best practices in structure, design, implementation, and working through problems, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.
* [58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere](https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/) - It's like a hyper-minimal version of [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/). Does one thing really well, but if that's what you need, it's perfect.
