I was inpired by zserge's post on [making a tiny 2x3 font](https://zserge.com/posts/tiny-font/) and wanted to see if I could make a readable 3x3 font myself. This challenge is exponentialy easier as there is so much more fidelity there, and it gave me a chance to play with Affinity Designer, which I'd never used before, as well as some basic bit shifting practice.

The end result is surprisingly readable, and even has punctuation!
