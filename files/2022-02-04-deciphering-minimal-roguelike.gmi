# Deciphering This Minimal Roguelike in C

I recently found this rad minimal roguelike and wanted to try and figure out what the heck is going on. It's only 512 bytes in C, which is insane, so I had to try and solve this little puzzle I was presented.

It's not worth going into super detail here, as it's all in the code, and seeing it move from a jumbled code salad into something meaningful is so fascinating to me.
