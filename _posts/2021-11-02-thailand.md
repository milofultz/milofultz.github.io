I'll be in Thailand working with Thornhenge on a software project. This means that I won't be able to receive calls or texts like I normally would except for maybe once a month when I turn my phone on and pay the extreme Verizon fees. You can still contact me via email or via [Signal](https://www.signal.org/).
