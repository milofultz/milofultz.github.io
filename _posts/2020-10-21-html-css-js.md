*CSS*

* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) (pre-Flex or Grid)
* [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) - Shows best practices in structure, design, implementation, and working through problems, taught by Jonas Schmedtmann.
* [58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere](https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/) - It's like a hyper-minimal version of [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/). Does one thing really well, but if that's what you need, it's perfect.
