{% raw %}{{SWIKI}}{% endraw %} is a flatfile wiki generator using Python. Using some basic configuration and template files, you can build a wiki out of Markdown files and some {% raw %}{{double brackets}}{% endraw %}. 

* Any page that is linked out locally will have the current page backlinked on that page, allowing for easy trawling through related information and finding new stuff.
* The structure of the web pages is defined by a static "frame" HTML file where the content is injected.
* Produces a "fatfile" page that contains all of the content of every page, which makes for easy searching of the entire wiki with just `ctrl` + `f`.

[Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/milofultz/swiki) to learn more about how it works, and go to <https://www.tinybrain.fans> to play around in a working demo.
