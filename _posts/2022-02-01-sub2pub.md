[Check out the project files on GitHub](https://github.com/milofultz/sub2pub)

Converts the subtitles of a Youtube video into an EPUB, using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [Calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/cli-index.html), and basic \*nix tools in the shell. This technically works with suto generated subtitles, but it isn't pretty.

Pretty much downloads the raw subtitle file from the YT server, formats everything as an HTML file, and then converst it directly. Works pretty well, and was really fun!
