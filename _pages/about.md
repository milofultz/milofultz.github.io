I miss the old internet.

Where everything was Times New Roman and you rummaged around people's websites to see what kind of stuff they were interested in. You'd read their treatises about some topic that was so foreign to you but you would get lost in it. It was like walking into somebody's workshop: half-finished ideas, seemingly throwaway creations, and really weird shit.

I wanted a place to put whatever I wanted, like a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) instead of a "perfectly" curated space for branding or whatever. My creativity suffers when I worry about image.
