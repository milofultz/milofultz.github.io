# Use uBlock To Set "No Style" as Default

I really like the default CSS styling for reading basic text and couldn't find a good solution with Stylus, so I figured out a good solution using uBlock:

```
example.com##link[rel="stylesheet"]:remove()
```

Don't know why this took me so long, but this definitely fixed my problem. Now I can browse in relative simplicity.
