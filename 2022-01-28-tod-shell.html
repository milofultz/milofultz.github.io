      <h1>Tod - Plan and Manage Daily Tasks In The CLI (Shell)</h1><p><a href="https://codeberg.org/milofultz/tod_sh">Check out the project files on Codeberg</a></p><p>A straightforward and simple task manager for your terminal.</p><p>Ever since I wrote Tod the first time, I've been using it for miscellaneous tasks at home and at work. It's proven very effective as a barebones way to maintain focus on what's important through the day and between sessions, and it's one less Electron app to burden my computer.</p><p><a href="2020-10-17-tod-python.html">The original Tod</a></p><p><a href="2020-11-09-the-point-of-diminis.html">The point of diminishing returns</a></p><p>In the meantime, I've completed a coding boot camp and started a new job working in full-stack web development, but still have a love of minimizing dependencies and aiming for ultimate simplicity without sacrificing usability. And while the Python implementation I have works, I knew I could make it simpler, faster, and less resource intensive.</p><h2>The Python Version</h2><p>While this version served me well, it has grown very crufty and become a bit unwieldy, considering its simple purpose (not unlike essentially any other task management application out there, s/o to Zawinski's Law). It became this way because this project was more or less a scratchpad for ideas and also that I built it when I had very bad (no) ideas regarding planning, maintenance, or any kind of long-termism.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski's_Law">Zawinski's Law</a></p><p>I've been using it for work and it slowly dawned on me that most of the things I do are really either not that important or could be done without spinlocking the terminal window the whole time the timer isn't running.</p><p>So my goals in improving Tod were:</p><ul><li>Removing the idle running of Tod when not active</li><li>Removing all the nasty un/underutilized cruft</li><li>Improving portability and simplicity</li><li>Learning more about C and the Shell</li></ul><p>So surprisingly, most of shell programming is simple. Unix tools seem to be able to do everything in regards to file or line manipulation, with `sed`, `awk`, and `perl` being the main players. The one non-shell thing I wanted to learn more about and use (which is still probably unnecessary, but fun) was C and ncurses to build a timer, which is still pretty darn simple, fun, and straightforward. And at the end of the day, I made my timer for this using a background process in the shell anyway.</p><p>Putting all this together, and it can do pretty much everything I care about on a day-to-day, though I will see what features I am missing from this stripped down version as I go. I love this process of rebuilding from scratch, seeing what I've learned and how I can do better, as I still suck at almost everything, but manage to suck a little less each time.</p>
