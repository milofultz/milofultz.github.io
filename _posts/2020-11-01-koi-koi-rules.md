Koi-Koi is a two-player game that is played
with Hanafuda cards. It requires a sharp
mind, strategic thinking, and risk-taking in
the spirit of friendly competition. It is truly a
classic brain training game.


### Goal:

The goal of Koi-Koi is to earn points by
making sets as fast as you can. Unlike
poker, whoever makes a set first can win a
game. A full session is 12 games, and the
player with the most points after 12 games
is the winner.


### Choosing a Dealer:

Players will choose one of the cards face
down, and the player who has the earliest
month card becomes the dealer (also
called “oya,” meaning “parent"), who takes
their turn first. Try not to choose the
“parent” in any other way, as this is the
authentic way of choosing the dealer in
Koi-Koi


### Playing the Game

The dealer will deal two cards at a time in
order of the player, field, and dealer. Deal
eight cards face down for each player, and
eight cards face up in the field in-between.
Place the remaining deck of cards to the
side of the field face down

After the players look at their cards, the
game will begin with the first player (the
dealer) taking one card from their hand
and placing it face up on the field. If the
card matches the month of any of the
cards on the field, the dealer takes the pair.
If there are no matching cards on the field,
that card will remain on the field face up.
The player will then pick a card from the
top of the remaining deck, and again if
there is a card of a matching month on the
field, the two cards will become a matching
pair. If not, the card will be placed on the
field face up. The player takes the
matching pairs, if they have any. and
places them face up in front of them,
ending their turn.

Continue to take turns playing until one of
the players comes up with a set. Tally the
points scored for that set, and continue
playing with a new game, with the winner
becoming the dealer. If either player is
unable to make a set and their cards run
out, the game is a draw and the other player
becomes the dealer in the next game.
 


### The Koi-Koi

After you make a set you can either end the
game there and earn the points for that one
set, or if you think you can get another, you
can call “Koi-Koi!” and keep playing to get
another set. Be careful though, because if
your opponent makes a set after you call
Koi-Koi before you make your second set,
the other player will double their points, and
the game will end. Koi-Koi can only be
called once per game.


#### Multipliers

If your sets total 7 or more points in a single
game, you earn a multiplier and get double
points! This is where you can win big, so
rack those points up!


### Lucky Hands

If the sets below are already made in your
hand when the cards are first handed out,
that player wins these points and the next
game will begin.

####  Four Hands

When there are four cards of the same
month: 6pts

#### Sticky

When there are four sets of two cards
fram the same month: 6pts

#### Special Card

The Chrysanthemum and Sake Cup card can be used
as a 10 or a 1 point card.
