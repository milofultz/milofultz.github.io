This website is both a repo for random [knowledge]({{ site.url }}/reference) I find, [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects), and [thoughts]({{ site.url }}/thoughts).

I am a musician, developer, and cat lover. I love doing pretty much anything with people I love but I also love being alone. Check out what I'm up to [right now]({{ site.url }}).

You can also dig around in my [wiki](http://www.tinybrain.fans) for a squashed look at what I do and what I find interesting.
