    <h1>Bookmark Crawler - Make Internet More Fun (Python)</h1><p>You can find the updated project and all necessary files on Codeberg</p><p><a href="https://codeberg.org/milofultz/bmcrawl">https://codeberg.org/milofultz/bmcrawl</a></p><h2>Goal</h2><p>Search engines are too broad and do not serve people who search for interesting and curated content that does not have relevant keywords. For example, searching "DIY Projects" will not yield interesting results, as those SEO search terms are saturated by bigger scale organizations and make finding smaller creators and curators much more difficult. As the internet gets larger and larger, this will only be more of a problem with modern search engines, as their algorithm rewards good SEO and Alexa rankings, which is determined not necessarily by quality of content, but by linking and optimization.</p><p>So if you want to find interesting and curated content regarding DIY projects, how can you find them? This is an experiment that utilizes given URL's to create an extremely specific set of links based on the sites that you already like. Hopefully this will provide the user with new domains and pages to explore that are related and recommended within the provided pages.</p><h2>How</h2><ul><li>Take a single URL or a user's bookmarks (exported from Firefox as an HTML file) and create a list of URLs to scrape.</li><li>Scrape each URL for links.</li><li>Allow process to repeat up to N degrees away from initial source URL.</li><li>Return an HTML file of new sites to explore.</li></ul>
