# SNAKEHACK - snake with constantly changing controls

=> https://github.com/milofultz/snake_js Check out the up-to-date version on GitHub

I just got started on this, but the goal is to make a snake game with more or less arbitrary rules that change as you play. Part Warioware, part snake, whatever.

Mainly making this as a way to practice basic website construction, HTML5 canvas drawing, and fun.
